# 机器学习笔记

## 深度学习方法

Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in AI. 
In this course, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. 
You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.

## 人工智能导论

What is this course about? 
What do web search, speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation, autonomous driving, and automatic scheduling have in common? 
These are all complex real-world problems, and the goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to tackle these with rigorous mathematical tools. 
In this course, you will learn the foundational principles that drive these applications and practice implementing some of these systems. 
Specific topics include **machine learning, search, game playing, Markov decision processes, constraint satisfaction, graphical models, and logic.** 
The main goal of the course is to equip you with the tools to tackle new AI problems you might encounter in life.
